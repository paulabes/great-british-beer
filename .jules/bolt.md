## 2026-01-26 - [N+1 in Template Slicing and Silent Failures]
**Learning:** Using `{% for item in related_manager.all|slice:":3" %}` in Django templates is a performance trap. It triggers a query for the slice, but often misses `select_related` optimizations for items within the loop, leading to N+1 queries. Additionally, accessing non-existent model fields in templates (e.g., `review.comment` instead of `review.content`) fails silently, hiding both bugs and potential performance issues (if properties were expected).
**Action:** Always fetch "related sidebars" (e.g., "Other Reviews", "Related Products") as a specific, optimized QuerySet in the View and pass it to the context. Avoid complex logic or slicing of related managers directly in templates. Verify field names against models when optimizing templates.
